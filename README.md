## Bike sales Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation using Microsoft Excel) 
## Project Objective:   
The **Bike Sales Dashboard** is designed to help businesses understand their customers better by exploring who is buying bikes, how far they travel, and the factors that influence their purchasing decisions. By analyzing trends such as income, age, commute distance, and demographics, businesses can tailor their strategies to meet customer needs effectively.
## Project Insights:   

1. **Income and Homeownership**:  
   - Customers who own homes tend to spend more on bikes, with male homeowners having the highest average income ($60,124), followed by female homeowners ($55,774).  
   - Non-homeowners, regardless of gender, spend less on average, highlighting homeownership as a potential indicator of purchasing power.  

2. **Age and Bike Purchases**:  
   - Middle-aged customers are the largest group buying bikes, showing a strong preference for this demographic.  
   - Younger (adolescent) and older customers make fewer purchases, suggesting businesses could create age-specific promotions to attract these groups.  

3. **Commute Distance**:  
   - Most customers travel shorter distances (0-1 miles) to buy bikes, indicating that proximity might play a significant role in sales.  
   - Sales decline sharply as the commute distance increases beyond 5 miles, pointing to the importance of having bike shops or delivery services closer to customers.  

4. **Flexible Filters**:  
   - Slicers for marital status, education level, and region allow businesses to drill down into specific customer segments and tailor offerings to their preferencences.
